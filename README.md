# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

### Welcome to the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** repository!

This repository is a treasure trove of Python programs that demonstrate various algorithms taught in the “Design and Analysis of Algorithms” course, a key subject in the CSIT curriculum.

Whether you’re a CSIT student delving into this subject or an algorithm enthusiast exploring new techniques, this repository offers a wide range of well-documented algorithms for you to learn from and experiment with. Enjoy your journey through the fascinating world of algorithms!

## Algorithms

### The algorithms covered in this repository are:

- Searching algorithms:
  - Linear search
- Sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Quick sort
- Divide & Conquer Algorithms:
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort

## Installation

To run the programs in this repository, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from [<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>].

## Usage

To run a program, navigate to the folder that contains the program and execute it using Python: <br>

```python
cd Sorting
python bubbleSort.py
```

using Javascript: <br>

```javascript
cd Searching
node linerSearch.js
```

using Objective-C: <br>

```objective-c
cd Searching
clang -framework Foundation -o linearSearch linearSearch.m
./linearSearch
```

Some programs may require input from the user or from a file. Please follow the instructions given in the comments or on the console.

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to this repository!

If you decide to contribute, please create a new folder for the language you’re adding and maintain the existing file structure.

## Project Roadmap

Our goal is to have implementations of all algorithms taught in the “Design and Analysis of Algorithms” course in multiple programming languages.

We’re starting with Python, but we aim to include other languages with your help.

We look forward to seeing this repository grow with your contributions.
